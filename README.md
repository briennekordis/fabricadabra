## Features
This application applies the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods to data that stores information about different fabrics, such as color and pattern. 
- On the "View My Stash" page, the user is able to see a table of data (fabrics) that has been retrieved from the database.

- When a user clicks on any of the individual rows, a modal appears displaying more details about the data, with the options to edit or delete the object.

## Future Improvements
This project is still in progress and has additional functionality planned, such as:
- Currently, the input fields of the "Add to My Stash" page are based on the coresponding numerical id's of the columns in the database table.
 However, this will be improved by binding the options so that the user will have a drop downlist to choose the inputs. 
- On the "View My Stash" page, search bars and filters will be added to improve the user's ability to sort through their stash.
- A "Stash Stats" page that will provide a summery of the user's data, such as how many total yards of fabric in their stash. 
- A "Project Planner" that will allow users to plot out their project plans, assign fabrics to be used for different projects, 
and mark projects as complete which will then deduct the amount of fabric used from the stash. 
- A "Settings" page that will allow the users to customize the options for their inputs, such as the names of different fabric types, patterns, sources, ext.
