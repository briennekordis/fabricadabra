## Features
This application applies the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods to data that stores information about different fabrics, such as color and pattern. 
- On the "View My Stash" page, the user is able to see a table of data (fabrics) that has been retrieved from the database.

- When a user clicks on any of the individual rows, a modal appears displaying more details about the data, with the options to edit or delete the object.

- From the "Add to My Stash" page, the user is able to create a new fabric object that will be added to the database.

- On the "Settings" page, there are collapsible components that display retrieved data from the database and allow users to view, edit, delete, and create new "settings" options (i.e. rows in data columns).

## Future Improvements
This project is still in progress and has additional functionality planned, such as:
- On the "View My Stash" page, search bars and filters will be added to improve the user's ability to sort through their stash.
- A "Stash Stats" page that will provide a summery of the user's data, such as how many total yards of fabric in their stash. 
- A "Project Planner" that will allow users to plot out their project plans, assign fabrics to be used for different projects, 
and mark projects as complete which will then deduct the amount of fabric used from the stash.
